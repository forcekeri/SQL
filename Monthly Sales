#In this SQL, I am using a database with multiple taables to quantify statistics about customer orders.

#1.	How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT Count(*) FROM JanSales WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2.	How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Count(*) FROM JanSales WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Product='iPhone';

#3.	Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT * FROM FebSales WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4.	Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
#OR
SELECT distinct Product, price FROM JanSales ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM JanSales WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' GROUP BY Product;

#6.	Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Sum(Quantity) as Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM FebSales 
WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7.	How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT Count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) FROM FebSales 
JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Quantity > 2;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) FROM febSales WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%' GROUP BY Product;
