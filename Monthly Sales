#4.	Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM customers
JOIN FebSales

WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
#OR
SELECT distinct Product, price FROM JanSales ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

SELECT Product, sum(quantity)*price AS Revenue FROM JanSales WHERE length(orderID)=6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' GROUP BY Product;
